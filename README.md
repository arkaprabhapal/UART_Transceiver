# UART_Transceiver
This is a project on designing UART Transceiver in verilog using AMD Vivado.

txin is the transmitted input and rxout is the received bits.

At the time when txdone and rxdone is 1, it represents the completion of process.
At this time we can see rxout = txin from my simulation results. So this design is working perfectly.
